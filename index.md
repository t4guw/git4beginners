# Recommendations for using git in the classroom at UWB

In this project, we work to configure a GitHub Classroom assignment for 
a CSS 142 programming course. We configured this demo assignment with 
the following features:

* Compilation checks on each `push` command using GitHub Actions
* Line length checks (80 chars max) using GitHub Actions
* Autograding student work using a GitHub Action designed specifically 
  for GitHub Classroom

The work here, as of June 2020, is a simple demonstration of how the 
GitHub Classroom platform can be leveraged to provide immediate, actionable 
feedback to students about code and documentation quality. Future work 
on this project might include:

* Developing autograding tests which provide meaningful output for 
  students, so that they can more easily understand why test cases are 
  failing and what those test cases are actually testing.
* Include more style-oriented actions, such as looking for JavaDoc 
  comments in each class or method, consistent indentation practices, 
  and resolving `TODO` comments in the code files.
* Developing individual lessons for laboratory classes which focus on 
  `git` usage and development environment setup so that students are 
  better prepared for success in the classroom.
