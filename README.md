# What is Git?
Put simply, a place to upload your code to the cloud for teams to collaborate on and people to see.
In our case, we use Git to upload homework and grade it automatically.

# Installing Git
1. Navigate to: https://desktop.github.com/ and download GitHub Desktop
2. Run the setup
3. Sign in using your Git Hub credentials. (Create an account if you don't already have one)

# How to use Git
1. We can use Git to get our homework and submit it.
  1. Git clone allows us to copy our repository (our online project file) to our computer.
  You can configure where you want to put the project but remember where you save it to.

2. Submitting your code (commiting and pushing). We commit our code to save the current state and `push` our code to the cloud.

  1. Some special cases may arrive when this does not work.
    1. Merging - Refers to when you attempt to push when your repository is outdated. 
    You would need to `pull` first which adds the changes from the new online version.
    To fix this, you have to go back to the file and fix any issues with your current file and `commit` and `push` again.
    In our case, this would rarely happen since homework assignments are most likely to be only published once.
  2. The message I type in the box can be seen as a comment for that commit on the online repository.
  3. After submission, you can hope to see some notification if your push passed or not.
3. Read the Readme.md for each of your assignments to learn what you need to change in that repository for submission.
